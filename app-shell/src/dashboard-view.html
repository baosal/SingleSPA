  <h2>Microfrontends in this project</h2>
  <p>
    This is a <strong>single-spa</strong> setup. The
    <strong>app-shell</strong> (root-config) owns routing and layout, and it
    mounts independent microfrontend applications into the page.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fixed apps</strong>: always visible (e.g. sidebar/header).</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Routed apps</strong>: mounted per route (e.g.
      <code>/module-1</code>, <code>/module-2</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Each microfrontend is an independent build with its own
      <code>package.json</code> and <code>webpack.config.js</code>, loaded at
      runtime via an import map.
    </li>
  </ul>
